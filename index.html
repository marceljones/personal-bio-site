      Marcel Jones, a native of the Jersey Shore, was born into a large family. Her father spent over 20 years as an active duty soldier in the U.S. Army, being a member of the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, also known as the Triple Nickels, the first all black parachute battalion in the history of the U.S. Army.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      As the youngest of 7, Marcel had several older siblings to teach and motivate her over the years and support her own interest.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      After completing a few years of college, Marcel met and married Roy Puryear, also a soldier and traveled the world for the next 10 years.  During that time, they welcome Stephen Anthony Puryear to the family.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While traveling the world ad raising their only child, Marcel worked in the accounting environment no matter where they landed.  Somewhere along their travels, she developed a passion for writing fictional stories.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      As life would have, Marcel and Roy Puryear are the proud grandparents to 5 year old Avi'Yana Mahri and two year old Kyng Puryear.</p>
    <p>
      Over the years and through my travels, I have met some very interesting people from all walks of life.  I have been exposed to a variety of hobbies and activities as well as creative ways to share family time with my native neighbors or transient military families like my own.</p>
    <p>
      As a result, I became accustomed to engaging in a variety of activities I otherwise would have avoided.  Some of which became regular hobbies I became quite good at.  They are listed below.</p>
